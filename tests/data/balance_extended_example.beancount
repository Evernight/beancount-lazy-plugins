; Example file demonstrating balance_extended plugin functionality

plugin "beancount_lazy_plugins.balance_extended"

; Open accounts with multiple currencies
2014-12-31 open Assets:Checking USD,EUR,GBP
2014-12-31 open Assets:Savings USD,CAD
2014-12-31 open Equity:Opening-Balances

; Example 1: balance full operation
; This will expand into separate balance assertions for EUR and USD
; Since the account is opened with USD,EUR,GBP, this will also create GBP 0 balance
2015-01-01 custom "balance" "full" Assets:Checking 100 EUR 230 USD

; Example 2: balance soft operation  
; This will create a pad directive on 2015-01-31 and balance assertions on 2015-02-01
2015-02-01 custom "balance" "soft" Assets:Checking Equity:Opening-Balances 150 EUR 300 USD

; Some transactions to make the example more realistic
2015-01-05 * "Deposit"
  Assets:Checking   50.00 USD
  Equity:Opening-Balances

2015-01-10 * "Currency exchange"
  Assets:Checking   25.00 EUR
  Assets:Checking  -30.00 USD

; Example 3: balance full with zero currencies demonstration
; The account Assets:Savings is opened with USD,CAD
; This balance directive only specifies USD, so CAD will be asserted as 0
2015-03-01 custom "balance" "full" Assets:Savings 500 USD

; Example 4: balance full with partial currencies
; This will create balance assertions for all currencies: CAD (25), USD (0)
2015-04-01 custom "balance" "full" Assets:Savings 25 CAD
